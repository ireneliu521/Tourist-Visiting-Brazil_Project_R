By Bella Sheng, Yirong Song, Yun-Hui Liu

The original data is posted on Brazilian Open Data Portal which is a tool provided by the government and the general public has access to all the dataset on this website. This dataset contains the number of international tourists arriving in Brazil each month from 1989 to 2015. The data is divided by continents and lists all the countries which can travel directly to Brazil, no matter what type of travel the tourists choose to use such as by air or by sea. Our objective in this study is to apply SARIMA model to predict the numbers of tourist visiting Brazil in the future 12 months.
